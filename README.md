# Auto Error Debugger Assistant with WatsonX

The idea behind this program is to create an automated debugging assistant using a chatbot with WatsonX. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it could work:

1. First, a user provides a piece of code to the program, which attempts to run it.
2. If the code runs without any errors, the program completes its task, and the user receives the output.
3. However, if an error occurs during execution, the program captures the error message and relevant code.
4. The error message and problematic code are then passed to the chatbot prompt, which is designed to understand and resolve code issues.
5. The chatbot analyzes the error message and code, identifies the problem, and suggests a solution to fix it.
6. The user receives the chatbot's proposed fix and can choose to apply the suggested changes to the code.
7. The modified code is then run again by the program.
8. If additional errors are encountered, steps 3-7 are repeated until the code runs without any issues.


Title: "Auto Error Debugger Assistant with WatsonX: A Streamlit Application for Debugging Python Code"

Introduction:

In this blog post, we will discuss how to create an Auto Error Debugger Assistant using WatsonX and Streamlit. This application will allow users to paste their Python code, and the assistant will debug it, providing fixes in real-time. We will guide you through setting up the Python environment, installing necessary packages, and implementing the full application code.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Access to a terminal or command prompt

Step 1: Set up a Python Virtual Environment

First, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Step 2: Install Streamlit

With the virtual environment activated, install Streamlit using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Step 3: Integrate Chatbot API

For this application, you will need to integrate a chatbot API, like WatsonX, which can analyze errors and provide code fixes. In this example, we assume you have access to a chatbot API and have implemented a function called `get_chatbot_suggestion` that takes the error and code as input and returns a suggested fix.

Step 4: Create the Streamlit Application

Create a new Python file (e.g., `debugger_app.py`) and paste the following code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
from some_chatbot_api import get_chatbot_suggestion  # Replace this with the actual chatbot API you plan to use


def run_code(code):
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(["python", "-c", code])
        return True, output.decode("utf-8")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, e.output.decode("utf-8")


st.title("Auto Error Debugger Assistant with WatsonX")

code_input = st.text_area("Paste your code here:", height=200)
fixed_code = st.empty()
output_zone = st.empty()

if st.button("Debug and Run"):
    code = code_input
    attempt = 1

    while True:
        output_zone.write(f"Attempt {attempt}: Running code...")
        success, output = run_code(code)
        if success:
            output_zone.write(f"Code executed successfully. Output: {output}")
            break
        else:
            error = output
            suggestion = get_chatbot_suggestion(error, code)  # Use your chatbot API to get the suggestion
            code = suggestion  # Update the code with the fixed version from the chatbot
            fixed_code.write(f"Suggested fix applied:\n{code}")
            output_zone.write(f"Trying again with the fixed code...")
            attempt += 1
```

Replace `from some_chatbot_api import get_chatbot_suggestion` with the actual chatbot API you plan to use and implement the `get_chatbot_suggestion` function to communicate with the chatbot.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit Application

To run the application, type the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
streamlit run debugger_app.py
```

This will launch the Streamlit application, which includes three zones:

1. The first zone allows users to paste the code they want to debug.
2. The second zone displays the fixed code provided by the chatbot.
3. The third zone shows the real-time output of the code execution, along with the current attempt.

Conclusion:

With the Auto Error Debugger Assistant using WatsonX and Streamlit, developers can efficiently debug their Python code and receive real-time suggestions for fixing errors. This application serves as a valuable tool for enhancing code quality and performance, saving time and effort in the debugging process.
